## Trollerscape

***If there is a hall of fame for Internet trolls... well, here it is.  A forum specially designed for trollers.***

Actually... this is really just a creative take on a web forum designed to showcase my programming skills using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, JQuery, ActiveRecord, AJAX, and web development tools in general. Content are for illustration purposes only and were mostly generated using the Faker gem.  The prompts were authored by myself, and were meant for its target audience (the Internet trolls), and by no means intended for the general public. (Rated-Trolls)

Graphics and UX/UI design are also created by me, except for the background patterns.
